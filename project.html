    <p> The world's longest above-water mountain range is the Andes,[1][2] about 7,000 km (4,300 mi) long. The range
        stretches from north to south through seven countries in South America, along the west coast of the continent:
        Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina. Aconcagua is the highest peak, at about 6,962
        m (22,841 ft).

        This list does not include submarine mountain ranges. If submarine mountains are included, the longest is the
        global mid-ocean ridge system which extends for about 65,000 km (40,000 mi).[3]

        The ocean is a huge body of saltwater that covers about 71 percent of Earth’s surface. The planet has one global
        ocean, though oceanographers and the countries of the world have traditionally divided it into four distinct
        regions: the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic oceans. Beginning in the 20th century, some oceanographers
        labeled the seas around Antarctica the Southern Ocean, and in 2021 National Geographic officially recognized
        this fifth ocean.
        An estimated 97 percent of the world’s water is found in the ocean. Because of this, the ocean has considerable
        impact on weather, temperature, and the food supply of humans and other organisms. Despite its size and impact
        on the lives of every organism on Earth, the ocean remains a mystery. More than 80 percent of the ocean has
        never been mapped, explored, or even seen by humans. A far greater percentage of the surfaces of the moon and
        the planet Mars has been mapped and studied than of our own ocean floor.

        Although there is much more to learn, oceanographers have already made some amazing discoveries. For example, we
        know that the ocean contains towering mountain ranges and deep canyons, known as trenches, just like those on
        land. The peak of the world’s tallest mountain—Mount Everest in the Himalaya, measuring 8.84 kilometers (5.49
        miles) high—would not even break the surface of the water if it was placed in the Pacific Ocean’s Mariana Trench
        or Philippine Trench, two of the deepest parts of the ocean.

        On the other hand, the Atlantic Ocean is relatively shallow

        Carbonated water (also known as soda water, sparkling water, fizzy water, club soda, water with gas, in many
        places as mineral water, or especially in the United States as seltzer or seltzer water) is water containing
        dissolved carbon dioxide gas, either artificially injected under pressure or occurring due to natural geological
        processes. Carbonation causes small bubbles to form, giving the water an effervescent quality. Common forms
        include sparkling natural mineral water, club soda, and commercially-produced sparkling water.[1]

        Club soda and sparkling mineral water and some other sparkling waters contain added or dissolved minerals such
        as potassium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate, or potassium sulfate. These occur naturally in
        some mineral waters but are also commonly added artificially to manufactured waters to mimic a natural flavor
        profile and offset the acidity of introducing carbon dioxide gas giving one a fizzy sensation. Various
        carbonated waters are sold in bottles and cans, with some also produced on demand by commercial carbonation
        systems in bars and restaurants, or made at home using a carbon dioxide cartridge.[2]

        It is thought that the first person to aerate water with carbon dioxide was William Brownrigg in 1740.[3] Joseph
        Priestley invented carbonated water, independently and by accident, in 1767 when he discovered a method of
        infusing water with carbon dioxide after having suspended a bowl of water above a beer vat at a brewery in
        Leeds, England.[4] He wrote of the "peculiar satisfaction" he found in drinking it, and in 1772 he published a
        paper entitled Impregnating Water with Fixed Air.[5][6] Priestley's apparatus, almost identical to that used by
        Henry Cavendish five years earlier, which featured a bladder between the generator and the absorption tank to
        regulate the flow of carbon dioxide, was soon joined by a wide range of others. However, it was not until 1781
        that carbonated water began being produced on a large scale with the establishment of companies specialized in
        producing artificial mineral water.[4] The first factory was built by Thomas Henry of Manchester, England.[4]
        Henry replaced the bladder in Priestley's system with large bellows.[4]

        While Priestley's discovery ultimately led to the creation of the soft drink industry—which began in 1783 when
        Johann Jacob Schweppe founded Schweppes to sell bottled soda water,[7] he did not benefit financially from his
        invention.[4] Priestley did however receive scientific recognition when the Council of the Royal Society "were
        moved to reward its discoverer with the Copley Medal" in 1772.[4][8]

        Although the word forest is commonly used, there is no universally recognised precise definition, with more than
        800 definitions of forest used around the world.[4] Although a forest is usually defined by the presence of
        trees, under many definitions an area completely lacking trees may still be considered a forest if it grew trees
        in the past, will grow trees in the future,[12] or was legally designated as a forest regardless of vegetation
        type.[13][14] <br>

        <img align="left" src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.4HyJddkv37Ss11vf3mR_mQHaEo?pid=ImgDet&rs=1" width="200px"
            height="200px">

        There are three broad categories of definitions of forest in use: administrative, land use, and land cover.[13]
        Administrative definitions are based primarily upon the legal designations of land, and commonly bear little
        relationship to its vegetation: land that is legally designated as a forest is defined as such even if no trees
        are growing on it.[13] Land-use definitions are based on the primary purpose that the land serves. For example,
        a forest may be defined as any land that is used primarily for production of timber. Under such a land-use
        definition, cleared roads or infrastructure within an area used for forestry—or areas that have been cleared by
        harvesting, disease, or fire—are still considered forests, even if they contain no trees. Land-cover definitions
        define forests based upon the type and density of vegetation growing on the land. Such definitions typically
        define a forest as an area growing trees above some threshold. These thresholds are typically the number of
        trees per area (density), the area of ground under the tree canopy (canopy cover) or the section of land that is
        occupied by the cross-section of tree trunks (basal area).[13] Under such land-cover definitions, an area of
        land can only be known as forest if it is growing trees. Areas that fail to meet the land-cover definition may
        be still included while immature trees are present that are expected to meet the definition at maturity.[13]

        Under land-use definitions, there is considerable variation on where the cutoff points are between a forest,
        woodland, and savanna. Under some definitions, to be considered a forest requires very high levels of tree
        canopy cover, from 60% to 100%,[15] which excludes woodlands and savannas, which have a lower canopy cover.
        Other definitions consider savannas to be a type of forest, and include all areas with tree canopies over
        10%.[12]

        Some areas covered with trees are legally defined as agricultural areas, e.g. Norway spruce plantations, under
        Austrian forest law, when the trees are being grown as Christmas trees and are below a certain height.

        Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals
        consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow
        sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been
        described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal
        species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres (110 ft). They have
        complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The scientific study
        of animals is known as zoology.

        Most living animal species are in Bilateria, a clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan. The
        Bilateria include the protostomes, containing animals such as nematodes, arthropods, flatworms, annelids and
        molluscs, and the deuterostomes, containing the echinoderms and the chordates, the latter including the
        vertebrates. Life forms interpreted as early animals were present in the Ediacaran biota of the late
        Precambrian. Many modern animal phyla became clearly established in the fossil record as marine species during
        the Cambrian explosion, which began around 539 million years ago. 6,331 groups of genes common to all living
        animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years
        ago.

        Historically, Aristotle divided animals into those with blood and those without. Carl Linnaeus created the first
        hierarchical biological classification for animals in 1758 with his Systema Naturae, which Jean-Baptiste Lamarck
        expanded into 14 phyla by 1809. In 1874, Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into the multicellular Metazoa
        (now synonymous with Animalia) and the Protozoa, single-celled organisms no longer considered animals. In modern
        times, the biological classification of animals relies on advanced techniques, such as molecular phylogenetics,
        which are effective at demonstrating the evolutionary relationships between taxa.

        Humans make use of many animal species, such as for food (including meat, milk, and eggs), for materials (such
        as leather and wool), as pets, and as working animals including for transport. Dogs have been used in hunting,
        as have birds of prey, while many terrestrial and aquatic animals were hunted for sports. Nonhuman animals have
        appeared in art from the earliest times and are featured in mythology and religion.
